# Overview

This project contains a template project to showcase all functionality of Zemu,
aswell as how to use Zemu in an application to accomplish various tasks.

It&rsquo;s aimed to showcase various functionality as well as be a starting template for a new
project using Zemu with Typescript


# Prerequisites

[Docker](https://docker.com) is needed for correct functionality of the package as it is relied upon for emulation encapsulation

[Yarn](https://yarn.com)/[NPM](https://nmpjs.com) is used in this template to configure and run configuration for this project


# Installation

Simply running `yarn install` is enough to install the dependencies and compile the typescript files.


# Usage

`yarn default` will execute `src/index.ts`, which won't work right away.
That's due to the lack of the application elf file and snapshots, but that's outside the scope of this demo
